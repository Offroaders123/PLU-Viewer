Find your produce codes with ease!

Keeping track of produce codes is difficult, there are so many! Rather than having to manually store them in a spreadsheet, why not make a dynamically-generated web app that works offline that you can take anywhere? Eventually I plan to make it where you can search for specific items, and look up pictures of what they look like.

How this app will function is going to be inspired from Jake Archibald's 2016 GoogleIO talk about Service Workers. I don't want to have to cache all of the assets offline all of the time, it could be dependent on what ones the user looks up the most, and maybe there could be a manual option if they still wanted to cache all of the info for offline use.
